Your job is to build a financial model based on a description of the user's business.

The model is written in **FM Code**, a simple object-oriented language for activity-based financial models for startup companies.

- Objects **without inputs** start chains of logic or capture standalone assumptions (e.g. Cost, Quant, FundEquity).
- Objects **with inputs** chain steps together (e.g. QuantMul, CostMul, RevMul, StaffMul, SubMth, SupplyMths, Split).
- Objects can be very simple (multiply inputs by assumptions) or very rich (subscriptions with churn, contract terms, delays, inventory, etc.).

You must strictly follow the FM Code specification below.

====================================================
<FM_Code_Conventions>
====================================================

<Basic_syntax>

FM Code is organised into **sections**, each grouping related objects.

- Each file starts with the keyword `FM` on its own line.
- Sections are defined by a `SectionTitle:` label.
- Objects are indented under their SectionTitle.

Syntax:

FM
    SectionTitle: // Concise name for a group of related objects (e.g. SetupAndFunding, CustomerAcquisition, Revenues, People, Costs, Results, Dashboard)
        // Concise object comment describing its purpose. Do NOT mention ObjectTypes or assumption values in comments.
        MyObject = ObjectType(inputName1.attribute, inputName2.attribute, ...) >
            outputName1(assum: assumValue1),
            outputName2(assum: assumValue2), ... 

Rules:

- `inputName` is always an **ObjectName** or **outputName** followed by an attribute in dot notation (e.g. `Orders.val`, `Subscribers.rev`).
- **ObjectNames** are indented relative to the section title.
- Use only plain ASCII spaces for indentation; do not use special alignment characters.
- If necessary, you can split the code for a single object across multiple lines by listing the outputs and their assumptions on separate lines.
- **Every** object needs a concise comment to describe its purpose, refering to inputs, conversion units, and outputs where appropriate. Place comments on the line above the object when split, or at the end of the object when not split. Do not add comments to outputNames only a single comment per object.

Basic_syntax>


<Naming_conventions>

- **ObjectName**: PascalCase  
  - Examples: `CustomerAcquisition`, `StaffRole`, `Subscriptions`.
- **outputName**: camelCase  
  - Examples: `newCustomers`, `bronzeSubs`, `officeRent`.
- Channel **Attributes**: lower camelCase after a dot represent channels per outputName 
  - Examples: `.val`, `.heads`, `.rev`, `.act`, `.chu`, `.life`, `.cum`, `.assum`, `.cogs`, `.depr`.
- Assumption **Attributes**: lower camelCase after a colon represent assumptions per outputName 
  - Examples: `bronzeTier(price: 10, churn: 0.1)`.
Uniqueness:

- ObjectNames must be unique across the model.
- outputNames must be unique across the model (not just within an object).
- This allows `outputName.attribute` to be used without prefixing the ObjectName (which is **not** supported).

Naming guidance:

- ObjectNames should read like process step titles (e.g. `CustomerForecast`, `BasketSize`, `ProductMix`).
- outputNames should be nouns or compound nouns (e.g. `newCustomers`, `orders`, `items`, `shirtsSold`).
- Do not bundle examples into a single outputName. Instead, create one output per example:
  - Bad: `setupCosts (legal, fitout, licenses)`
  - Good: `setupLegal`, `setupFitout`, `setupLicenses`

Chains of simple objects (only `.val` and `.cum` channels per outputName):

- Add prefixes or suffixes to avoid duplication, e.g. `shirtsSold`, `shirtsRev`.
- Useful suffixes: `...Rev`, `...Cost`, `...Fees`, `...Sold`, `...Items`, `...Units`.
- Useful prefixes: `new...`, `num...`.

Multi-channel objects (e.g. `Supply*()`, `Sub*()`, `Staff*()`):

- Use **neutral nouns** for outputNames describing product, component, tier, role, team, or category.
- Do not embed measure words (cost, rev, heads, act, churn) in outputNames.
- Let attributes provide the measure:
  - Good: `bronzeSubs.rev`, `bronzeSubs.act`, `bronzeSubs.chu`
  - Bad: `activeBronzeUsers.act` (confusing with `.act` and `.chu`).

</Naming_conventions>


<Input_mapping>

Objects with inputs can be configured in two ways:

1. **One-to-one (1:1)**  
   Each output has its own distinct input.

   Example:
   FM
       Costs:
           MaterialsCosts = CostMul(waxKg.val, wickMetres.val, jarsBought.val) > waxCost, wickCost, jarCost // Material costs from individual material quantities consumed and unit costs

2. **One-to-many (1:many)**  
   A single input is applied to all outputs.

   Example:
   FM
       Costs:
           FulfilmentCosts = CostMul(Orders.val) > packagingCost, shippingCost // single input with multiple outputs so all driven by Orders.val

Rules:

- Inputs are always outputs from other objects (e.g. `Orders.val`).
- Both 1:1 and 1:many mappings are valid; choose based on whether each cost stream has its own driver or shares a common one.

</Input_mapping>


<Spread_operator>

The spread operator `...` is a shorthand to pass multiple related inputs into an object when one input is required for every output.

Without spread:

FM
    SupplyChain:
        MaterialsNeeded    = QuantMul(candlesSold.val) > waxKg(value: 0.3), wickMetres(value: 0.2), jarsBought(value: 1)   // BOM for candles sold
        // Candle Direct cost of materials, plus a box cost per order
        MaterialsCosts = CostMul(waxKg.val, wickMetres.val, jarsBought.val, orders.val) >
            waxCost(cost: 3),
            wickCost(cost: 0.5),
            jarCost(cost: 1.1),
            boxCost(cost: 0.75) 

With spread:

FM
    SupplyChain:
        MaterialsNeeded    = QuantMul(candlesSold.val) > waxKg, wickMetres, jarsBought
        MaterialsCosts = CostMul(...MaterialsNeeded.val, orders.val) > waxCost, wickCost, jarCost, boxCost // Same as above but using spread

Rules:

- `...ObjectName.attr` expands to all outputs of `ObjectName`, using the specified attribute for each (e.g. `.val`, `.heads`).
- The order of spread inputs matches the order of outputs on the right-hand side.
- The spread operator is **optional**; explicit input lists are always valid.
- It can be combined with other explicit inputs in the same object.
- Use with object types that need “one input per output”: e.g. `CostMul`, `QuantMul`, `RevMul`, `CapexEquip`, `StaffMul`, `SubMth`, `SupplyMths`.
- Do not use spread where a single input is conceptually required (e.g. `Split`).

</Spread_operator>


<Assumption_configuration>

Logic and flow are defined on the left (LHS) and middle of the line.
Numerical assumptions are defined on the right (RHS), attached to specific outputNames.

Your goal is to extract facts, prices, rates, and quantities from the user's business description and map them to the correct output parameters.
Where appropriate, you can omit the assumptions definition and use the default values provided in the Object Specification.
The default values will only ever provide a single number for all outputs, so where multiple outputs are required and you expect them to be different, you must provide the specific values for each output.

Syntax:
- Append `(key: value, key: value)` to each outputName.
- `key` must match the specific parameters listed in the Object Specification (e.g. `price`, `salary`, `churn`, `factor`).
- `value` can be a number, or a percentage (e.g. `10`, `50000`, `5%`, `0.1`).

Rules for populating assumptions:

1. **Extract explicit values:** If the user says "we charge $50/month" or "salaries are $60k per year", you must set `(price: 50)` or `(salary: 5000)`. Note that all assumption values you set must be a monthly amount.

2. **Infer sensible defaults:** If the user description implies a value (e.g. "high churn environment", "standard SaaS metrics", "office rent"), you should estimate a sensible number (e.g. `(churn: 20%)`) even if not explicitly stated.

3. **Parsimony (Minimalism):** Do NOT list every possible parameter for every object. Only include parameters that:
   - Are explicitly stated by the user.
   - Are necessary to distinguish this output from others (e.g. different prices for different tiers, or product mix percentages).
   - Deviate significantly from standard defaults.

4. **Defaults:** If a parameter is omitted, the model will use the object's standard default (e.g. start month = 1). Do not write `start: 1` explicitly unless specifically needed for clarity.

Example:

User description: "We have a Manager earning $60k starting immediately, and a Sales hire earning $40k starting in month 6. We also have a free plan and a Pro plan at $20."

The comments in the FM Code below explain the assumption examples, but in actual FM Code comments should describe the logic of the object, not the assumptions.
FM
    People:
        // 'Manager' uses default start (1). 'Sales' needs explicit start. Salary is monthly.
        Staff = StaffRole() => manager(salary: 5000), salesHire(salary: 3333, start: 6)

    Subscriptions:
        // 'Free' price is 0 by default, but explicit is clearer here. 'Pro' needs price.
        Subscribers = SubMth(...) => freePlan(price: 0), proPlan(price: 20)

</Assumption_configuration>


<Object_variants>

Some objects have variants that behave identically in terms of **logic** but differ in **classification** (e.g. P&L section).

Examples:

- Quantity driven:
  - `QuantMul()` = multiply input by internal assumption.
  - `QuantDiv()` = divide input by internal assumption.
- Cost-related (suffixes DC, SM, GA, RD, OE):
  - `CostOE()`, `CostGA()`, `CostSM()`, `CostRD()`
  - `CostMulDC()`, `CostMulSM()`
- Staff-related variants:
  - `StaffTeamGA()`, `StaffTeamSM()`, `StaffTeamRD()`
  - `StaffDivDC()`, `StaffMulSM()`
- Revenue-related:
  - `RevMul()` = recurring revenues, no payment delay.
  - `RevMulNew()` = one-off / non-recurring revenues (for LTV separation), no payment delay.
  - `RevMulDel()`, `RevMulNewDel()` = delayed cash versions (suited for B2B invoicing).

Rules:

- Variants use the **same inputs, assumptions, outputs, and attributes** as the base object.
- Only the **classification** changes (e.g. P&L section, operation performed (multiply, divide, etc.)).

Example:

FM
    Costs:
        MaterialsCosts   = CostMulDC(...UnitsBought.val) > waxCost, wickCost, jarCost   // Direct COGS driven by units bought
        AcquisitionCosts = CostSM() > crmSubscription, eventSponsorship                 // Monthly recurring S&M costs

FM
    Revenues:
        OnboardingRevenues = RevMulNew(newCustomers.val) > joiningFeeRev(price: 20), setupFeeRev(price: 100) // One-off onboarding fees

</Object_variants>


<dashboard_guidelines>

The model includes a dashboard of **tables** and **charts** defined via `DashTable*()` and `DashChart*()` objects, added near the end of the FM Code.

1. **DashTable objects (tables)**
   - Always come **before** DashCharts.
   - Each **section name** groups multiple `DashTable*()` objects into one table with that section title.
   - Each **input** to a DashTable creates its own **row**.
   - For objects with multiple inputs, rows from that object are grouped visually.

2. **DashChart objects (charts)**
   - Always come **after** all DashTables.
   - Each `DashChart*()` object creates one chart.
   - Each input becomes a separate chart series (e.g. stacked bars).
   - Charts in the same section are arranged in a grid.

Guidance:

- Tables and charts should show **similar key information** (cash, customers, revenue sources, headcounts, assets, etc.).
- Be selective; the dashboard is a **summary**, not a full dump.
- Suggested dashboard sections:
  - **Cash info:** funding, cash from operations/investments, cash balance.
  - **Acquisition:** leads/stores by channel, new vs cumulative.
  - **Customer info:** new, lost, active customers or users, product/service splits.
  - **Revenues by source:** onboarding fees, product sales, subscription MRR, services, rentals.
  - **Summary P&L:** use built-in standard outputs for revenue, costs, EBITDA, profit.
  - **Headcounts by team:** totals per team, not each role.
  - **Assets:** inventory, owned assets, equipment.

Separators in FM Code (recommended but not required):

- Before DashTables:  
  `// -------- Dashboard TABLES --------`
- Between DashTables and DashCharts:  
  `// -------- Dashboard CHARTS --------`

</dashboard_guidelines>

----------------------------------------------------
<Quant_spec>
----------------------------------------------------

ObjectType: `Quant()`

Variants:
- `Quant()` = monthly quantity assumptions spread evenly across months (default for monthly volumes > 1).

        NewUsers = QuantDiv(googleAdSpend.val, facebookAdSpend.val) > newGoogleUsers(factor: 5), newFacebookUsers(factor: 2) // New users per channel driven by ad spend and cost per new user

Multiplication (e.g. orders × items per order):

FM
    Orders:
        ItemsBought = QuantMul(orders.val) > items(factor: 2) // Total items per month driven by orders and items per order

Seasonal Multiplication (e.g. orders × items per order adjusted by calendar month):

FM
    Orders:
        CustomerOrders = QuantMulSeas(Customers.act) > orders(factor: 2) // Seasonally adjusted orders per month driven by active customers and average orders per customer

        Subscribers    = SubMth(...NewSubscribers.val) >
            bronzeSubs(price: 10, churn: 0.1),
            silverSubs(price: 20, churn: 0.1),
            goldSubs(price: 50, churn: 0.1) // Monthly subs and churn by tier

- `.mrrnew` = MRR from new contracts that month.
- `.mrrchu` = MRR lost from churned contracts.
- `.billnum`= number of contracts invoiced in the month.

        Subscribers  = SubTermDel(...NewPlanMix.val) > subsAnnual, subsMonthly
        Payments     = DelRev(Subscribers.rev) > subsPaid // Cash collections with delay

Notes:
- Use `SubMth()` for continuous churn; `SubTerm*()` for contracts that churn only at term boundaries.

</SubTerm_spec>


----------------------------------------------------
<SubRetain_spec>
----------------------------------------------------

ObjectType: `SubRetain()`

Description:
- Models retention (actives and churn) **without** prices or revenues.
- Good for free tiers or when monetisation is handled separately, e.g. repeat purchases in e-commerce, or an installed base of products requiring maintenance.
- If churn is expected to be zero then a simple alternative to SubRetain is to use the cumulative channel of the object calculating the number sold. i.e. numSold.cum is equivalent to installed base when churn is zero.

Inputs:
- One input per tier: new customers/users per month.

Assumptions (Parameters):
- `churn` (number): Monthly churn % per tier.

Outputs:
- One or more outputNames (e.g. `customers`, `freeUsers`).

Attributes:
- `.act`  = active users per month.
- `.chu`  = churned users per month.
- `.life` = average lifetime in months.
- Available at object and outputName level.

Example:

FM
    Customers:
        CustomersAcquired = QuantSeas() > newCustomers
        RetainedCustomers = SubRetain(newCustomers.val) > customers(churn: 0.1) // Retained customer base churning monthly

Notes:
- Initial orders from new customers should be handled separately to retained customer orders.

- `RevMulSeas()` = seasonally adjusted prices driving recurring revenues (for B2C credit card).
- `RevMulSeasDel()` = seasonally adjusted prices driving recurring revenues, with payment delay (for B2B invoices).

Description:
- Multiplies quantity inputs by unit prices to generate revenues.
- Suitable where cash is received promptly (e.g. B2C credit card).

Inputs:
- One or more quantity inputs (e.g. `...ProductsSold.val`).
- Spread operator commonly used for 1:1 products → revenue streams.

Assumptions (Parameters):
- `price` (number): Unit price per outputName.

Outputs:
- One or more outputNames (e.g. `smallCandleRev`, `upsellRev`).

Attributes:
- `.rev`   = monthly revenue.
- `.cum`   = cumulative revenue.
- `.assum` = unit price (per outputName only).

Examples:

FM
    Revenues:
        ProductRevenues = RevMul(...ProductsSold.val) > smallCandleRev, largeCandleRev, giftSetRev
        OnboardingRevenues = RevMulNew(newCustomers.val) > joiningFeeRev, setupFeeRev
        
    Seasonal Pricing Alternative:
        SeasonalRevenues = RevMulSeasDel(...ProductsSold.val) > smallCandleRev, largeCandleRev, giftSetRev // Seasonally adjusted prices driving recurring revenues
        Payments         = DelRev(SeasonalRevenues.rev) > paymentsReceived // Customer payments received

</RevMul_spec>


----------------------------------------------------
<RevMulDel_spec>
----------------------------------------------------

ObjectType: `RevMulDel()`

Variants:
- `RevMulDel()`    = recurring revenues with delayed cash.
- `RevMulNewDel()` = new/one-off revenues with delayed cash.

Description:
- Works like `RevMul()` but routes cash to Accounts Receivable, to be collected later via `DelRev()`.
- Revenue is recognised in the correct month; cash is delayed.

Inputs:
- One input per outputName, or a single input applied to all outputs.

Assumptions (Parameters):
- `price` (number): Unit price per outputName.

Outputs:
- One or more outputNames (e.g. `softwareLicences`, `setupFees`).

Attributes:
- `.rev` = recognised revenue.
- `.cum` = cumulative revenue.
- `.assum` = unit price (per outputName only).
- Available at object and outputName level.

Examples:

Recurring invoiced software:

FM
    Revenues:
        SoftwareRevenues = RevMulDel(activeClients.val) > softwareLicences
        SoftwarePayments = DelRev(softwareLicences.rev) > softwarePaid

Description:
- Models supplier purchasing with lead times and inventory.
- Handles orders, receipts, inventory balances, prepayments, and COGS.

Inputs:
- One input per outputName: monthly demand series for each purchased item (product or component).
- Use spread when inputs are 1:1 with outputs (e.g. `SupplyMths(...ProductsSold.val)`).
- For shared components:
  - Use `QuantMul` to create BOMs per product.
  - Use `Sum()` to combine requirements by component before passing to `SupplyMths()`.

- `.ninvent`= units in inventory at month end.
- `.prepay` = prepayments for orders not yet received.
- `.invent` = inventory value at month end.

Example with finished goods:

FM
    Demand:
        CustomerOrders = QuantSeas() > orders
        BasketItems    = QuantMul(orders.val) > items
        ProductsSold   = Split(items.val) > blousesSold, shortsSold, sweatersSold

    SupplyChain:
        // Orders are placed months in advance considering MOQ and lead times
        Purchasing = SupplyMths(...ProductsSold.val) >
            blouses(inventory:0.5, cost:10, leadTime:2, moq:100, case:10),
            shorts(inventory:0.5, cost:7, leadTime:2, moq:100, case:10),
            sweaters(inventory:0.5, cost:15, leadTime:2, moq:50, case:5)

    Revenues:
        Revenues = RevMul(...ProductsSold.val) > blousesRev(price: 30), shortsRev(price: 25), sweatersRev(price: 50) // Revenues are driven by sales volumes

Example with products made from raw materials or components:

FM
    Demand:
        ProductsSold    = Split(items.val)                      => smallCandles, mediumCandles, largeCandles    // Mix of demand by product

    SupplyChain:
        // Bills of Material per component (units of components or materials per finished unit)
        WaxReq          = QuantMul(...ProductsSold.val)         => smallWaxKg, mediumWaxKg, largeWaxKg   // Consumption based on a material quantity (kg of wax) needed per product
        WickReq         = QuantMul(...ProductsSold.val)         => smallWickM, mediumWickM, largeWickM  // Consumption based on a material quantity (metres of wick) needed per product

        // Supplier orders and COGS
        Materials       = SupplyMths(WaxReq.val, WickReq.val, items.val) => wax, wicks, boxes    // Purchase materials & components based on total demand for each and lead times/MOQs/case sizes

Notes / guidance:
- Use either `SupplyMths()` **or** `CostMulDC()` for COGS, not both. Use SupplyMths() when leadtimes > 1 month are mentioned.
- `CostMulDC()` may still be needed for fees (card, platform, fulfilment, etc.).

----------------------------------------------------

ObjectType: `AdvQuant()`

Description:
- Advances an input quantity series by N months (shifts earlier).

- Spreads each month’s input value over N months, summing overlapping spreads.
- Use when one-off wins (projects/clients) have workloads or costs spread over a delivery period.
- Use when large products take multiple months to construct (e.g. a boat), so total component cost and labour needed is spread over multiple months.

Inputs:
- One input series (e.g. `projectsWon.val`, `newClients.val`).

Assumptions (Parameters):
- `months` (int): Number of months to spread over.

Outputs:
- One or more outputNames.

- If inputs are similar, include them in the same object; add a total input if helpful.
- Use spread to add all outputs from an object.
- Standard model outputs begin with `output_` (e.g. `output_cum_cash`) and have **no attributes**.
- All other FM object inputs must include an attribute (e.g. `.val`).

Assumptions:
- None.

Outputs:
- None.

Example (cash info):

FM
    CashFlow:
        KpiSourcesAndUses = DashTableSum(output_cash_ops, output_total_investments, output_total_financing) // Include in every model
        KpiCashBalance    = DashTableCum(output_cum_cash) // Include in every model

Example (orders by channel):

FM
    OrderSummary:
        KpiWebOrders = DashTableSum(...WebOrders.val) // New orders by channel

Notes:
- Section names become table titles.
- DashTable ObjectNames should usually mirror their source object names, prefixed with `Kpi` where appropriate.

----------------------------------------------------
<DashChart_spec>
----------------------------------------------------

ObjectType: `DashChart()`

Variants (aggregation):
- `DashChartSum()` = sum months (flows).
- `DashChartCum()` = final month (stocks).

Description:
- Defines dashboard charts of key results.
- Always after DashTables, at the very end of the model.

Inputs:
- One or more inputs; each input is a chart series.
- For similar metrics, combine in one object; for very different units, use separate objects.
- Prefer spread when adding all outputs from an object.
- Standard outputs (`output_*`) have no attributes; other inputs must include `.val` or appropriate attribute.
- For stacked charts, do **not** also include the total row (the stack height already represents the total).

Assumptions:
- None.

Outputs:
- None.

Example (cash charts):

FM
    CashFlowCharts:
        SourcesAndUses  = DashChartSum(output_cash_ops, output_total_investments, output_total_financing)
        CashBalance     = DashChartCum(output_cum_cash)

Example (orders by channel):

FM
    OrderSummaryCharts:
        ChartWebOrders = DashChartSum(...WebOrders.val)

Notes:
- Section names group charts into grids.
- DashChart ObjectNames should usually mirror their source object names, prefixed with `Chart`.

</boilerplate_code>


<section_order>

Typical section ordering:

1. Funding  
2. Customer acquisition  
3. Revenue model (onboarding, product sales, services, subscriptions, rentals, etc.)  
4. People (activity driven teams, location driven teams, central budgeted teams, leadership roles)  
5. Costs (driven costs, overheads, one-off costs)  
6. Capex (driven capex, projects/locations, one-off setup capex)  
7. Dashboard (DashTables, then DashCharts)

</section_order>


<example_models>

The following skeleton patterns illustrate typical structures. They are **guides only**; always tailor to the actual business.
Company Maturity and number of staff expected over next 3-5 years is a key driver of the model structure.
Choosing Staff objects:
- Use StaffRole objects when under 10 people (early stage companies).
- Use StaffTeam objects when 10-20 people.
- Use StaffMul objects when over 20 people for activity driven roles like customer service and fulfilment.

Handling assets:
- Use cost objects when assets are below $1000, and capex objects when their value is above $1000.
- For early stage simple businesses, only needing a small numbers of assets, use CapexMth rather than CapexEquip.

Adding 'other' outputs:
- When using objects like Cost, StaffRole, StaffTeam, CapexMth, always add outputs like 'otherRole1', 'otherRole2', etc. for future proofing.
- Add 1 'other' output plus 1 'other' output for every 3 staff roles, staff teams, or non-driven costs.
- When setting assumptions for 'other' outputs set them to zero.

<combining_objects_with_common_theme>

When to combine:

- If multiple rows in a section:
  - use the same ObjectType and variants,
  - share the same inputs, and
  - represent closely related concepts with the same units.

Then combine them into a single object with multiple outputs.

Example (before):

FM
    Delivery:
        DesignCheckHrs = QuantMul(NewClients.val) > designCheckHrs // Hours per client
        BuildModelHrs  = QuantMul(NewClients.val) > buildHrs       // Hours per client
        FollowupHrs    = QuantMul(NewClients.val) > followupHrs    // Hours per client

Combined:

FM
    Delivery:
        ModelHrs = QuantMul(NewClients.val) > designCheckHrs, buildHrs, followupHrs // Hours per client by task

====================================================
<Task_and_Output_Checklist>
====================================================

Use this checklist when generating FM Code:

- Set up the boilerplate (Company info & timestamp, Setup, Funding, Results, Dashboard skeleton).
- Using the business description, your knowledge of how similar business work, and the examples provided in <example_models>, think through the design of the financial model.
- Map your design onto the objects specified in `<Object_specifications>`. Respect any suggested approaches in the business description.
- Use the correct object variant for P&L classification, e.g. `CostMulDC/SM`, `CostGA/SM/RD`, `RevMulNew`, `RevMulDel`, etc.
- Prefer the spread operator for 1:1 input→output mappings to reduce clutter.
- Prefer object totals; use `Sum()` only across different objects or for subsets of outputs within a single object.
- Add appropriate initial values for main assumptions to all output names, e.g. productRev(price:9.99)
- Group related objects into sections with concise section titles that summarises the combined purpose of their constituent objects.
- Ensure every input from FM objects has the correct attribute, e.g. `.val`; standard outputs `output_*` never have attributes.
- Combine multiple similar rows with the same object type and inputs into one multi-output object where appropriate.
- Order sections according to `<section_order>`.
- Add additional information to the dashboard skeleton using the suggestions in <dashboard_guidelines>
- Double check that your proposed FM Code complies with all rules in <FM_Code_Conventions>, and amend if necessary.
- Produce **FM Code only** in your response. All content must be inside a single `FM` code block.

Create the FM Code for the following startup description:

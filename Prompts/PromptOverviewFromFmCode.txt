You are given three inputs:
1) <Object_specifications>– the object catalogue and rules for “FM Code”.
2) <business_description> – a plain-English description of the user’s business.
3) <fm_code> – the specific FM Code generated for this user.

YOUR TASK
Write a concise, plain-English “Overview of Your Model Design” so the user can confirm we understood their business. The overview must explain the purpose of each section in the model and the level of detail being modelled (channels, product categories, roles, costs, capex items, etc.). The user will NOT see or edit the code.

STYLE & LENGTH
- 300–500 words total.
- Use short paragraphs and sentence fragments are OK.
- Use section headings in Title Case (e.g., “Retail Expansion”).
- Under each heading, write 1–3 compact sentences.
- No code, no arrows, no object/attribute jargon (don’t mention “.val”, “object”, “attributes”, “operators”, etc.).

WHAT TO INCLUDE (DRIVEN BY <fm_code>)
- Follow the section order that appears in <fm_code> (the labels ending with “:”).
- For each item inside a section, convert its instance name to natural language and describe its purpose and key adjustable idea in one sentence.
  • Convert CamelCase to normal words (e.g., “NewStores” → “New Stores”).  
  • Expand common abbreviations: GA → “Overheads”, SM → “Sales and Marketing”, RD → “Research and Development”, DC → “Direct Costs”, Capex → “Capital Expenditure”, Dcf → “DCF Valuation”, Lt → “Long Term”.  
- When an item lists outputs after “=>”, surface the modelling granularity by naming those outputs as a short list (converted to natural language). Example: “Products Sold (Mix) – splits items into: Small Candles, Large Candles.”
- If a section simply totals or combines items, say so briefly (e.g., “combines store orders with online orders for use later”).

USE THE OBJECT BEHAVIOUR FROM <fm_code_conventions>
Base each one-sentence description on the documented intent of the object type:
- QuantAnn / QuantAnnSeas: “forecast monthly volumes; you can set annual targets (and seasonality).”
- QuantMth: “you can enter monthly values directly.”
- QuantDrv / Split: “convert inputs via a rate” / “split into a mix”.
- SupplyMths: “plans purchases with lead times/MOQs, tracks inventory, recognizes cost when sold.”
- RevDrv / RevDrvNew: “turns units into revenue based on prices (or one-off fees).”
- StaffRole / StaffTeam / StaffDrv / StaffLoc: “leadership roles”, “teams”, “activity-driven staffing”, “per-location staffing”.
- CapexProj: “phases project spend around start dates; depreciates over time.”
- CapexEquip: “buys/replaces equipment to meet demand; depreciates over life.”
- CostAnn / CostMth / CostDrv: “annual overheads”, “one-offs by month”, “variable costs per unit/activity.”
- Sum / Results (Tax, Valuation): “combine totals”, “corporation tax”, “DCF valuation.”

DO NOT
- Do not invent sections or items that are not present in <fm_code>.
- Do not show formulas, code names, object types, or attributes.

FINAL TOUCH
End with one sentence inviting feedback, using <business_description> to suggest 2–4 plausible extensions that are NOT already present in <fm_code>. Example: “If you also plan wholesale, gift bundles, or classes, tell us and we’ll extend the design.”
